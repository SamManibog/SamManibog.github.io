## Why to Make Creative Software

At its core, engineering is a creative endeavor. While most artists use a brush, software engineers use a keyboard. Artists use pointillism, watercolor, or hatching as a basis for their works, while we use OOP, functional programming, or data-oriented design. Personally, I’ve never been much of an artist, but I enjoy art in all forms, from animation to drawing to sound design. Consequently, I aim to build my engineering career in creative software development.

## How to Make Create Software

I’ve always viewed technology as an aide to humans. It should help us with daily tasks and remove limits on our creativity, so those will be my goals for the apps I develop. Consequently, there are a few standards that my software must uphold:

- It must be fast. Otherwise, people’s creative spark may die out while my apps handle input.
- It must be understandable; so understandable that a 5-year-old could use it. Artists have enough to think about, and figuring out how to use my UI should not be one of them.
- It must be scalable. Tastes and styles constantly change and evolve, so plenty of new features will need to be added to keep up. However, this requires a well-structured codebase.

Each of these components is related to a practical computer science concept that must be mastered. They are algorithms, UI/UX, and structure, respectively. Experience with these will come from study and practice. When it comes to education, I prefer a learn by doing approach and will rely on personal projects and open-source contributions to develop in these areas. For the latter, learning proper communication will be key and is a special focus in my career. But I don’t discount more traditional studying either. Part of being able to write quality code is knowing what quality code looks like, and you’ll never know without study and analysis.

Ultimately, in this ever-changing world and increasingly competitive profession, the goal of every software engineer must be to adapt and to learn how to utilize all available tools effectively. While my personal interests nudge me towards a specific niche of software engineering, the strategies that I have outlined apply to a wide variety of projects. I hope that by refining our craft, we will help build a world where technology bolsters the human experience.
